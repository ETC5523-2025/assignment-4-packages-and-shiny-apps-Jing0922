# NitrateExplorer

## Overview

The `NEONNitrateExplorer` package provides tools to explore and analyze nitrate concentration data in surface water from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). It includes a user-friendly Shiny application for interactive data visualization and exploration.


## Installation

You can install the development version of NitrateExplorer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-Jing0922")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(NitrateExplorer)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.


## Data Source

The package uses data from the **[NEON Surface Water Nitrate (DP1.20033.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20033.001/RELEASE-2025)** product. The data includes:

- **Sites**: ARIK (Arikaree River), COMO (Como Creek), KING (Kings Creek), LEWI (Lewis Run), MAYF (Mayberry Creek)
- **Time Period**: January 2018 - December 2023
- **Variables**: 
  - `surfWaterNitrateMean`: Mean nitrate concentration (mg/L)
  - `surfWaterNitrateMinimum`: Minimum nitrate concentration
  - `surfWaterNitrateMaximum`: Maximum nitrate concentration  
  - `surfWaterNitrateStdErMean`: Standard error of the mean
  - `finalQF`: Quality flag (0 = pass, 1 = fail)

## Data Cleaning

The raw data has been processed to:
- Remove records with missing nitrate concentration values
- Filter for quality-approved data only (`finalQF == 0`)
- Standardize datetime formats
- Select relevant variables for analysis
